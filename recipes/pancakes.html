            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                    <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
                    <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
                    <li>½ cup milk</li>
                    <li>3 eggs</li>
                    <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong> Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Make the pancakes:</strong> Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
